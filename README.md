# Java-REST-Client-Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of a REST client built with Node.js to perform real-time communication with an external RESTful API. Originally designed as a Java-based REST client, the functionality has been replicated using Node.js and Express to showcase flexible backend development and REST API interaction.

The application interacts with the public API JSON Placeholder to simulate full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data. It includes a simple and responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to:

--------View all users

--------Search a user by ID

--------Add a new user

--------Update existing user information

--------Delete a user by ID

Although the API is mock-based and doesn’t permanently store data, it effectively demonstrates the structure and behavior of RESTful services. The project serves as a hands-on exercise in consuming APIs, managing HTTP requests/responses, and building interactive user interfaces — making it a practical showcase of backend-to-frontend integration.

This system is ideal for beginners and intermediate developers aiming to understand RESTful architecture, HTTP methods, and frontend-backend synchronization without the complexity of database management.
